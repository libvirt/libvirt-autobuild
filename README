       libvirt automated build
       =======================

This is a trivial package which just provides the configuration files
required to perform an automated build of libvirt and all related
modules, using Test-AutoBuild (http://autobuild.org). The RPM spec
file included ensures that all build pre-requisites are correctly
installed
